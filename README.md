# Mazaady
* The following project is using POM (Page Object Model) design pattern
* It consists of two Main Test classes: one for the Login, and Product Page including four steps
* Soft annotations are used as per task specifications
* Depending on the selected product, relevant data are filled accordingly....
* Auction Details, Exchange and Return Policies are covered.
* In my case I used Classification: CLOTHING, SHOES , BAGS, subCategory: Clothes Abaya including Size, BrandType, Location and MainImage
* Multipart directory for the product Image, video
* Manual Testing helped me understand the business before establishing the automation test framework.
* To achieve 100% test coverage, More business classifications study is needed and I faced minor issues.
* Get redirected to: https://staging.mazaady.com/login and start the test Journey : )
* Start it by running the ProductTest.java Test class
* Uploading Main Image requires putting An Image named Image.java at the User Folder to work correctly.
